# Data Structures Sorting Techniques
This project implements the sorting of linked list using main sorting techniques of the data structures such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. 

**Question 1:**
Given a singly linked list of alphabets (both lower and upper case), use *selection sort* to sort the linked list in ascending order. Treat upper and lower case alphabets separately, that is, 'a' is larger than 'A' and so on.
 
**Question 2:**
Given a singly linked list of alphabets (both lower and upper case), use *bubble sort* to sort the linked list in ascending order. Treat upper and lower case alphabets separately, that is, 'a' is larger than 'A' and so on.

**Question 3:**
Given a singly linked list of alphabets (both lower and upper case), use *insertion sort* to sort the linked list in ascending order. Treat upper and lower case alphabets separately, that is, 'a' is larger than 'A' and so on.

**Question 4:**
Write a program that reads the integer n and m, followed by a matrix (that is, a table) of n rows and m columns of real numbers.  Sort the rows of this matrix according to their sums.
For example with the input
3	4

1.2	1.0	6.0	8.0
0.4	9.0	0.0	1.1
5.2	1.0	3.5	1.5
Rows have sums 16.2, 10.5, 11.2. The output should be	

0.4	9.0	0.0	1.1
5.2	1.0	3.5	1.5
1.2	1.0	6.0	8.0

**Question 5:**
Write a program that reads integer n followed by a sequence of n integers. Sort the integers of this sequence according to the sum of their digits.
For example, if the input data is
4
11111	  321	  39 	45

The output will be
11111	   321	  45	39

Since the sum of their digits is 5, 6, 9 and 12 respectively.
